# Phishing_website
Detection of Phishing Websites

In this project we are creating a model to predict whether a particular URL is safe-listed or
blocklisted. We are doing this by considering the features of a URL and including factors like URL length, special
characters, prefixes, suffixes, and more. Thus, identifying the websites based on these features. This model can help
detect phishing sites and can help reduce damage caused by phishing attacks. To create this model, we extracted data
from the below datasets. Specifically, we aim to create a classification-based model that will classify those URLs as
legitimate, and fake based on the feature classification.
